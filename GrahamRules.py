'''While Graham was skeptical about anyone being able to accurately predict the growth in earnings
 of
 a company, he wanted to invest in companies that are increasing their profits consistently. 
 This was an indication that the company was heading in the right direction. 
 He recommends defensive investors to look for companies that have experienced a 
 minimum increase of 33% in earnings per share over the last 10 years using three-year averages 
 at the beginning and the end.'''
